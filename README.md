# Org-mode and scientific writing project management

55-minute [talk](https://mediasite.ouhsc.edu/Mediasite/Channel/python/browse/null/most-recent/null/0/null) given at the 2024 November 22 Oklahoma Data Science Workshop meeting. 
The slides contain numerous valuable hyperlinks for new and not-so-new Emacs users.
Seven overflow slides were discussed after the official end of the talk.
The discussion lasted for 25 minutes.
The associated init.el file is located [here](https://github.com/MooersLab/dsw-2024-org-mode-init).

This talk refers to an excellent [talk](https://mediasite.ouhsc.edu/Mediasite/Channel/python/watch/356583673e7e40a1828990acb60f7f061d) in March 2024 by Dr. Marcus Birkenkrahe.
He introduced Emacs and Org-mode to the Data Science Workshop.
The AI-generated images in this talk are also outstanding.

## For those new to Emacs

Consider [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/videos.en.html). 
It supports drag-and-drop assembly of scientific papers. 
It is available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux with drag-and-drop installers.
This is a heavy wrapper around GNU Emacs.
There is a series of short videos to get you started.
