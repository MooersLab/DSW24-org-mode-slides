## For those new to Emacs

Consider [TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/videos.en.html). 
It supports drag-and-drop assembly of scientific papers. 
It is available for MacOS, Windows, and Linux with drag-and-drop installers.
This is a heavy wrapper around GNU Emacs.
There is a series of short videos to get you started.
